Create database:
create database mydb2;

Use that database:
use mydb2;

create table:
create table flight(fno int,year int,dest varchar(10),delay float)
-->row format delimited
-->field terminated by ','
-->lines terminated by '\n'
-->stored as textfile;

Rename table:
alter table flight rename to air_flight

Add column:
alter table flight add columns(source varchar(10));

Delete table:
drop table flight;

Display table:
desc flight;

Insert values:
insert into flight values(123,2009,"Mumbai",30.6);

Show content of table:
select *from flight;

Join tables:
create table nflight(fno int,year int,dest varchar(10))
-->row format delimited
-->field terminated by ','
-->lines terminated by '\n'
-->stored as textfile;

insert records in nflight table;
Allies for both tables:
select a.fno,a.year,a.dest,a.delay,b.fno);
-->from flight a.join nflight b;------->describe allies 
-->on (a.fno=bfno)------------#primary key

To store result in new table: cascade tables
c


Load table:
In terminal 1:-
create file
cat filename;
copy file in hdfs(Hadoop file sys)

in terminal2:
load data inpath '_____copy path____' overwrite into flight table;


Aggregation functions:
1]Sum():
	select sum(salary)from employee;
2]Avg():
	select avg(salary) from employee;
3]Max():
	select max(salary) from employee;
4]Min():
	select min(salary) from employee;
5]Count():
	select count(*) from employee;


From text file to table:
Termainal1:-
gedit f.txt;
In text file insert records in the same order as the table in which they are to be inserted.
pwd;
ls;--------#hive table and text file should be in same env

Terminal2:
load data local path "f.txt"
-->overwrite into table flight;

select *form flight;
